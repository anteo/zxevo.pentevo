# Source formatters

Four small programs, one job each:

| Program | Job | Own options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `formatter` | routes files by extension, proxies arguments | `--EXT-formatter=PROGRAM`, `-h` |
| `format_asm` | assembly: `awk` with `<dialect>.awk` | `--dialect`, `--check` |
| `format_c` | C and headers: `clang-format` with `z88dk-c.clang-format` | `--clang-format`, `--style`, `--check` |
| `format_md` | Markdown: Prettier with `.prettierrc.json` | `--prettier`, `--config`, `--check` |

```sh
tools/formatter/formatter src include asm          # mixed list, one call
tools/formatter/formatter --check src              # forwards --check
tools/formatter/formatter --dialect=z80asm asm     # forwards to format_asm
tools/formatter/format_asm --dialect z80asm src    # direct, own options
tools/formatter/format_c --clang-format /opt/bin/clang-format src

## formatter: routing and proxying

`formatter` knows nothing about languages or tools, only extensions and
programs. Built-in mapping: `*.c` and `*.h` go to `format_c`, `*.md` goes to
`format_md`, and other files go to `format_asm`. Built-in helpers are looked
up next to `formatter` first, then on `PATH`. `--EXT-formatter=PROGRAM`
replaces a mapping for any suffix, for example `--inc-formatter=format_asm`.

Any argument the dispatcher does not use itself is forwarded unchanged to every
formatter run it launches, and files are passed after `--`. Because the
dispatcher does not know which options take a value, forwarded options must be
self-contained: write `--dialect=z80asm`, not `--dialect z80asm`.

Exit status is the worst status of the runs it launched: `0` success, `1` from
`--check` with files to reformat, `2` usage or formatter error.

## Helpers

Helpers accept an explicit file list or directories (`format_asm` expands
`*.asm`, `format_c` expands `*.c` and `*.h`, `format_md` expands `*.md`) and
process explicit files whatever their extension. Files are rewritten only when the formatted content
differs, and content is written only after the formatter succeeded, so a
failing run never leaves a truncated file.

`format_asm --dialect NAME` selects `NAME.awk` (`sjasm` or `z80asm`); the
default comes from `$FORMAT_ASM_DIALECT`. `format_c --clang-format PATH`
selects the executable (default `$CLANG_FORMAT`, then `clang-format`), and
`--style PATH` replaces the bundled `z88dk-c.clang-format`. Each helper lists
the options it accepts with `--options`, which is how the dispatcher routes
forwarded arguments; the environment variables are only the defaults for
running a helper directly.

`format_md --prettier PATH` selects Prettier (default `$PRETTIER`, then
`prettier`), and `--config PATH` replaces the bundled
`tools/formatter/.prettierrc.json`.

Rules:

- **sjasm** aligns statements and constants and normalizes hex literals for
  SjASMPlus: instructions and directives get one 8-space indent, labels and
  `EQU`/`EVAL` constants go to the left margin with aligned values, `#hex`
  becomes `0xhex`.
- **z80asm** only normalizes leading indentation and blank lines. Operands,
  `00BFh` literals, local `@labels`, `AF'`, quoted semicolons, expressions and
  the spacing before comments survive byte for byte.
- **z88dk-c** sets 4-space indent, attached braces, right pointer alignment, a
  100-column limit, preserved `#include` order and comment text, and declares
  `__z88dk_fastcall` as an attribute macro. The style always comes from this
  directory, so the result never depends on the caller's directory. Editors can
  reuse it with `clang-format --style=file:tools/formatter/z88dk-c.clang-format`.

## Makefile use

Projects include the shared fragment instead of repeating the commands:

```make
FORMAT_FILES   := $(wildcard src/*.c src/*.h src/*.asm)
FORMATTER_ARGS := --dialect=z80asm   # optional, forwarded by option name

include ../tools/formatter/formatter.mk   # keep this last
```

The list is never split by language: the dispatcher routes per file and finds
`format_c`/`format_asm` next to itself, so the fragment adds no paths or
defaults of its own. `FORMATTER_ARGS` carries the dispatcher options and is
empty by default; each one reaches only the formatters that declare it, so
`--dialect=z80asm` never confuses `format_c`. The fragment also restores the
project's default goal, so a bare `make` still builds. `make
CLANG_FORMAT=/path format` keeps working because make exports command-line
variables, and a project that pins the binary can pass
`--clang-format=$(CLANG_FORMAT)` in `FORMATTER_ARGS`.

| Target | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `format` | `$(FORMAT_FILES)` in one dispatcher call |
| `format-check` | `--check` over the same list; fails when a file needs work |
| `format-plan` | prints the dispatcher and the selected files |

There is no per-language target: the list is one set of files, and only the
dispatcher decides who formats each file. To format a single language, call
that helper directly, for example `tools/formatter/format_c src include`.

The fragment must be included after the project's own rules: the first target
of an included file would otherwise become the default goal.

## Adding a formatter

Write a program that accepts a list of files, handles `--check`, and lists its
own options with `--options` (one name per line, without leading dashes; exit
non-zero if it has no such protocol and it will receive every forwarded
argument). Map it with `--EXT-formatter=PROGRAM`. Nothing in `formatter` or in
the make fragment needs to change.
