# z88dk appmake BaseConf extension

This directory contains the project-owned `+baseconf` backend and a small
registration patch for z88dk appmake. It does not vendor upstream appmake
sources. To build, provide an existing z88dk source tree:

```sh
Z88DK_SRC=/path/to/z88dk/src make
```

The build script stages the supplied appmake sources under the ignored local
`build/` directory, applies `patches/baseconf-registration.patch`, adds
`baseconf.c`, builds the upstream appmake, then removes the temporary source
staging area. It does not modify `Z88DK_SRC`. The output is
`build/z88dk-appmake`; `make clean` removes that output.

A C compiler, `make`, `patch`, and GMP development files are required. The
script uses `pkg-config` for GMP flags when available and falls back to
`-lgmp`. The target tree must have the standard z88dk layout containing
`appmake/`, `common/dirname.{c,h}`, and `config.h`.

## Provenance and license

The backend was developed against z88dk source version
`26724-9fc3cae210-20261103` from `/Users/anton/.z88dk/src` on 2026-11-04.
The script accepts another compatible source tree through `Z88DK_SRC`; its
version is printed during the build. Upstream appmake source and its original
notices are taken from that tree. z88dk's Clarified Artistic License is in
the source tree's parent `LICENSE` file. The registration patch records its
local modification and this repository retains the corresponding project
source for the new backend.

## Use

For a zcc target configuration that selects the BaseConf CRT, set its
`APPMAKEEXE` entry to the built executable:

```ini
APPMAKEEXE = "/absolute/path/to/tools/appmake/build/z88dk-appmake"
```

Then use zcc's normal app creation flow (`SUBTYPE` is the configured target
name):

```sh
zcc +SUBTYPE tap -Cz+baseconf -Cz--name=MYPROGRAM -create-app \
  -o build/program src/main.c
```

Until that target configuration points at the local binary, invoke it
directly:

```sh
tools/appmake/build/z88dk-appmake +baseconf \
  --binfile build/program --crt0file build/program --output build/program.tap
```

The linked map and section binaries must follow z88dk appmake naming and be
available next to the supplied base name. The target reads addresses and
sizes from the map rather than demo-specific filenames.

## Target behavior

- Writes a tokenized Spectrum BASIC loader and standard TAP CODE blocks.
- Names the BASIC and main CODE blocks `BASECONF` by default. Pass
  `--name=NAME` (or zcc `-Cz--name=NAME`) to set another program name. Names
  must contain 1–10 characters and are padded to the standard 10-byte TAP
  field. Bank blocks use `BANK000`–`BANK255` by default; pass
  `--bank-prefix=PREFIX` (or zcc `-Cz--bank-prefix=PREFIX`) to set a 1–7
  character prefix. The three-digit page number is appended to each prefix.
- Combines initialized main-bank sections into one contiguous image, filling
  address gaps with zero bytes. BSS is excluded from initialized payload.
- Assumes the standard BaseConf ERS/BAS48 startup has configured RAM mode and
  CPU frequency; the BASIC loader does not write `FF77` or `EFF7`. For each
  `BANK_n` section set, it briefly opens the BaseConf shadow port, selects
  physical page `n` in W3 (`C000–FFFF`) through the full-page `F7F7` register,
  then closes the access window.
- Defaults the load origin to the first initialized section and the BASIC
  `USR` entry to the map symbol `start` when present. This distinction matters
  when initialized DATA is located at `0x7000` while `start` remains at
  `0x8000`. If the map has no `start`, the load origin is used. BASIC CLEAR
  defaults to `0x5fff`. `--org`, `--usraddr`, and
  `--clearaddr` override these values. `start` includes the CRT startup code;
  do not use `__CODE_head`, which begins after it.
- Combines a bank's sections into one 16 KiB W3 image and loads pages in
  ascending order.

The main image must fit in the 16-bit address space; each bank must fit W3.
Page selection occurs during BASIC-controlled loading, not while program code
is executing.
