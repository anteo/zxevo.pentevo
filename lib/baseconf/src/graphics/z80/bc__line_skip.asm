SECTION code_graphics
PUBLIC bc__line_skip

; Jump over the invisible prefix of a Bresenham line and recover its phase.
;
; scaled = skipped * minor_delta + (major_delta - 1) / 2;
; return (scaled / major_delta, major_delta - 1 - scaled % major_delta);
;
; HL=skipped, BC=minor_delta, DE=major_delta. Return HL=minor steps, DE=error.
; Requires 0 < major_delta and minor_delta <= major_delta. Preserve IX/IY,
; clobber AF/BC. A counts bits, BC is quotient, DE is divisor, HL is remainder.
; IX points at the shifting copy of skipped, with minor_delta at IX+2.
