; bc_status_t bc_covox_play(const uint8_t *samples, uint16_t length)
; Playback loop adapted from z88dk libsrc/classic/games/playzb4_dac.asm,
; based on SG C Tools 1.7, (C) 1993 Steve Goldsmith.
; Adapted for BaseConf on 2026-11-05: fixed port, SDCC entry and status,
; and correct handling of every nonzero 16-bit sample length.

defc BC_AUDIO_COVOX_PORT = $00fb

; Plays a packed 4-bit sample buffer through Covox, sending the high nibble
; first and waiting until playback finishes.
;
; Model:
;
; if (!samples || !length) return INVALID_ARGUMENT;
; for (i=0; i<length; ++i) { delay(); OUT(0x00fb,samples[i]&0xf0);
;     delay(); OUT(0x00fb,(samples[i]<<4)&0xf0); } return OK;
;
; Caller-clean pointers/length at SP+2/+4, status in HL. Sample bytes stay
; readable for the blocking call. AF/BC/DE/HL volatile; IX/IY preserved.
; Counted delays depend on CPU speed and interrupt latency; IFF is unchanged.
; Length is decomposed into a first partial block and full 256-byte blocks;
; incrementing D when E!=0 fixes the original short/non-multiple-of-256 case.
